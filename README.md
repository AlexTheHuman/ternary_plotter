# ternary_plotter

Modify points.txt with the points you want to plot. Put each point on a different line.

The format is:
TOP value, LEFT value, RIGHT value, COLOR, TEXT LABEL

Once you have modified and saved points.txt, run ternary_plotter.exe or ternary_plotter.py (if you have python installed).

Selected the chart you want to plot your points on, and an image of the plot will be displayed and also saved to disk with a timestamp.
